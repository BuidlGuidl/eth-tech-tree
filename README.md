# ETH Development Tech Tree
Test your skills and find some new ones by completing challenges.

There are three different types of nodes on the tree:
- [x] Challenges: A repository that poses a problem that you must solve with Solidity. You deploy your contract and submit your contract address so we can test it to ensure your solution works, allowing you to progress.
- [ ] Quizzes: Links to source material that will help you to master a topic that will be encountered in later challenges.
- [ ] Capstone Projects: These are large scale projects that stretch your knowledge about the ecosystem. A description of the project is provided but it is up to you to fulfill the description.

## Quick Start
Run the following command to use the NPM package
```bash
       npx eth-tech-tree
```
The CLI visualizes several categories which contain challenges. Navigate with your arrow keys and hit enter to view options for a challenge. Follow the instructions in your CLI to complete challenges fill out your Ethereum dev tech skills.

## Development
Clone and `cd` into the repo then run this CLI application with the following commands
- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn cli`

## TODO
- [ ] Show users how many challenges they have completed in a category
- [ ] Show users where they rank on a leaderboard
- [ ] Onchain NFT mint or attestations showing a user has completed certain challenges
- [ ] Enable Gas Efficiency CTF element
